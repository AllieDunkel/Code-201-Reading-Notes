## Reading Assignment 7

### Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptaul model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as, the constraints that govern the problem domain. A domain model thats articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among vaious stakeholders

### HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

- layouts tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users
- tables produce tag soup: hard to read
- tables are not automatically responsive 

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

- < thead >
- < tfoot >
- < tbody >


### Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

- A constructor is just a function called using the 'new' keyword
- you use it when you have more than one object 

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

- object literals are fine when you only need to create one object but if you need to create more 'this' enables you to use the same methods definition for every object you create


### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

- when i comes to inheritance, javascript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype
- inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more
